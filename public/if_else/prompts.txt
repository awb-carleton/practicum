This file contains the various prompts that would be called on each line
of our pseudocode

3: If/Else: Before starting, note the separate if/else blocks that are highlighted.
4: Initialization: What are the starting values of our variables?
8: Conditionals: We're at the beginning of a new if/else block. Let's find the first branch that evaluates to true.
9: Booleans: What does this expression evaluate to?
--IF TRUE: Go to line 11
--IF FALSE: Got to line 10
10: If/Else: Since this test evaluated to false, we won't go into this branch.
11: If/Else: Since this branch evaluated to true, we won't enter any of the following branches.
13: Assignment: What is the value of this variable after this line executes?
15: Answer: Now use your variable bank to fill in the answer!

Below is our original prompts, which we're keeping for now as we're finalizing things:


If/Else: Before starting, note the separate if/else blocks that are highlighted.

Initialization: What are the starting values of our variables?
1
Initialization: What is the starting value of this variable?
2		x	3	y	20
Conditionals: We're at the beginning of a new if/else block. Let's find the first branch that evaluates to true.
4		z	4
Booleans: What does this expression evaluate to?
4
If/Else: Since this test evaluated to false, we won't go into this branch.
4	5	false
If/Else: We enter this else branch because all other tests in this structure evaluated to false
6
Assignment: What is the value of this variable after this line executes?
7
Conditionals: We're at the beginning of a new if/else block. Let's find the first branch that evaluates to true.
10		z	13
Booleans: What does this expression evaluate to?
10
If/Else: Since this test evaluated to false, we won't go into this branch.
10	11	false
Booleans: What does this expression evaluate to?
12
If/Else: Since this branch evaluated to true, we won't enter any of the following branches.
12	14,15	true
Assignment: What is the value of this variable after this line executes?
13	
Answer: Now use your variable bank to fill in the answer!
17		y	17
